      <h1>Fantastic Four</h1>
      <p>
        The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American
        comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in The
        Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a
        new level of realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first
        superhero team created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and
        artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, who developed a collaborative approach to
        creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.

          The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four,
          who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a
          scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed
          Richards), a <br />
          <br />
          scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his
          body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible Girl (Susan
          "Sue" Storm; later "Invisible Woman"), who eventually married Reed,
          who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible
          force fields;<br />
          <br />
          the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can
          generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous
          Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former
          college football star and Reed's college roommate as well as a good
          pilot,<br />
          <br />
          who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability, and
          endurance due to the nature of his stone-like flesh.

          Since their original 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been
          portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, <br /><br />
          yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic book
          archetypes of the time, they would squabble and hold grudges both deep
          and petty and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of
          celebrity status. <br /><br />
          The team is also well known for its recurring encounters with
          characters such as the villainous monarch Doctor Doom,<br />
          <br />
          Kree Empire's ruthless and tyrant leader Ronan the Accuser, the
          planet-devouring Galactus, the sea-dwelling prince Namor, the
          spacefaring Silver Surfer and the shape-changing alien Skrulls.

          Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime magazine and comic
          book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack
          Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as
          National Periodical Publications, <br /><br />
          and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new
          superhero team the Justice League of America.[note 1] While film
          producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the
          particulars of that story, <br /><br />[note 2] Goodman, a publishing
          trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics
          editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of
          superheroes. According to Lee,<br /><br />
          writing in 1974, "Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the
          titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than
          most. It was a book called The [sic] Justice League of America and it
          was composed of a team of superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is
          selling',<br /><br />
          spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of
          superheroes?'"[1]:16
