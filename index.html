      <h1>Fantastic Four</h1>
      <p>
        The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American
        comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in The
        Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a
        new level of realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first
        superhero team created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and
        artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, who developed a collaborative approach to
        creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.

          The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four,
          who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a
          scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed
          Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can
          stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible
          Girl (Susan "Sue" Storm; later "Invisible Woman"), who eventually
          married Reed, who can render herself invisible and later project
          powerful invisible force fields; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue's
          younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them
          and fly; and the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but
          benevolent friend, a former college football star and Reed's college
          roommate as well as a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman
          strength, durability, and endurance due to the nature of his
          stone-like flesh.

          Since their original 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four have been
          portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking
          convention with other comic book archetypes of the time, they would
          squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty and eschewed anonymity
          or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. The team is also
          well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the
          villainous monarch Doctor Doom, Kree Empire's ruthless and tyrant
          leader Ronan the Accuser, the planet-devouring Galactus, the
          sea-dwelling prince Namor, the spacefaring Silver Surfer and the
          shape-changing alien Skrulls.

          Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime magazine and comic
          book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack
          Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as
          National Periodical Publications, and that the top executive bragged
          about DC's success with the new superhero team the Justice League of
          America.[note 1] While film producer and comics historian Michael
          Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story,[note 2] Goodman, a
          publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct
          his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a
          team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, "Martin
          mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National
          Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The
          [sic] Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of
          superheroes. ... 'If the Justice League is selling', spoke he, 'why
          don't we put out a comic book that features a team of
          superheroes?'"[1]:16
